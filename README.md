Introduction
Driving a vehicle is a daily task that many of us have become accustomed to. However, it’s also one that carries a certain element of danger. Although we may not think about it, as motorists, we are constantly relying on signage and road markings to direct us, guide us and advise us. Usually just a quick glance at these pointers is all we need to absorb the appropriate information, but if these signs or markings are unclear, it can be hazardous for motorists and pedestrians alike. In this article we will be exploring the importance of road markings, examining road marking issues on roads, and highlighting the solutions.
Why are road markings important? Keeping road markings in visible and understandable condition is vital for road safety. They help road users to navigate the road systems, making us aware of upcoming hazards and of key bits of information to help us drive appropriately for the situation. The reliance on these features cannot be exaggerated, and without their clarity, it can cause confusion on the roads. Road markings are especially important at nighttime when, in the dark conditions, we rely on their presence even more so.
Road markings can tell us vital pieces of information, such as:
•	 Bus and cycle lines
•	 Upcoming hazards
•	 Speed limits
•	 Single and double yellow lines
•	 Lines to separate lanes of traffic
•	 Give way lines

Research part
Compared to previous years, the state of road markings has declined in quality and clarity. A study conducted in 2011 by the Road Safety Marking Association revealed the worrying statistics that only 29% of a sample of A-road lines reached the levels of visibility that were deemed acceptable, with a concerning 14% assessed as being ‘completely worn out’. This means that in recent times too many road linings have fallen below safe standards, which could negatively impact the driving safety of drivers. Motorists should be aware of these fallen standards whilst on the roads and drive with extra caution.


Solution
In accordance with the existing issue, we present mini prototype
One-Gogh is smart road marking machine based on arduino platform. Our project is a device that allows you to autonomously apply road markings. 
   

The steps and the process of study:

1. After identifying the problem and setting the terms of reference, our team began to develop possible solutions.
 2. Having created a model, we started developing a 3D model which would satisfy our ideas for a future project.
 3. In the process of work and group discussion, we identified flaws and improved our prototype. 
4. The parts obtained were finalized and printed on a school 3D printer. 
5. To create a working prototype, the Arduino platform was chosen, for which we wrote the program code.
 6. In conclusion, we conducted a final test of the device, where it was identified, and then corrected, its main flaws.



Conclusion
Road markings ensure the safety of the motorists, drivers and pedestrians while they are on the road. Accidents can certainly be avoided if the roads have proper line markings. Road line markings, therefore, should be taken into serious consideration, and be included when it comes to road planning and safety.

Thus, our prototype is the best solution for applying road marking.
